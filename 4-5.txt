These are the steps for going from demo4.hs to demo5.hs.

First we change the model from a pair to a list of pairs:

main >>>   (100,100) -> (replicate 30 (0,0))
draw >>>   (x,y) -> (_:blobs)
draw >>>   f [1..20] -> blob blobs
blob >>>   r -> (x,y)
blob >>>   r 0 -> x y
blob >>>   10 20 -> 5 10
comment out ev

plug ev back in:

ev >>>     _ -> xy
ev >>>     xy -> xy:b

Finally, add the step and drift functions.
